        <p class="par">The LetKnow Exchange Platform is an exchange-based order book for various pairings of digital
            assets and fiat funds such as euros. When a user places an order, the exchange platform automatically

            LetKnow Trade Platform is a European based cryptocurrency marketplace that brings buyers and sellers of
            cryptocurrencies together to make their transactions.</p>
        <p class="par">Before using the LetKnow World Platforms, you should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or
            holding digital assets is substantial and that the value of digital assets is subject to extreme volatility.
            You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding digital assets is suitable for you in
            light of your financial condition.
        </p>
        <p class="par">By using the LetKnow World Platforms, you agree to comply with these terms of use. Please check

            accept at the relevant time. To the extent of any inconsistency with these terms, the terms of those LetKnow
            World Services will apply to those Services and any matters connected with them. These terms, together with

            If you do not agree to these terms, or refuse to recognise LetKnowâs right to make amendments to these terms

            the purposes of storing, tracking, transferring, managing and trading balances of supported digital assets
            as well as certain types of funds as specified by LetKnow from time to time.</p>
        <p class="par">2.2 LetKnow provides you an informational and order-matching exchange and trading services by
            displaying prices for digital assets being traded on the LetKnow World Platforms at any given time.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.3 You must comply with any instructions we give you about how to use the LetKnow World
            Platforms and must not do anything that interferes with or adversely affects the normal operation of the
            LetKnow World Platforms (including the ability of other users to access or use the LetKnow World Platforms).
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.4 Before transferring digital assets or funds into your LetKnow digital wallets, you must
            ensure that the digital assets in question are supported by the LetKnow digital wallets. You should not use
            the LetKnow digital wallets to store unsupported digital assets or funds and doing so may result in the
            forfeiture of your digital assets. LetKnow does not take any responsibility for any attempted use or storage
            of unsupported digital assets in a LetKnow digital wallet.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.5 LetKnow does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation
            of digital assets. Generally, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify and
            distribute them. LetKnow assumes no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and LetKnow
            is not able to guarantee either the accuracy of the information provided or the functionality, security,
            legality or availability of the underlying protocols. You acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying
            software protocols relating to any digital assets you store in any LetKnow digital wallet may change.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.6 You may withdraw digital assets from your LetKnow digital wallet by transferring them to an
            external digital asset wallet. The withdrawal of digital assets may be subject to periodic withdrawal
            limits.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.7 LetKnow will process the orders you place on the LetKnow World Platforms in accordance with
            the instructions received from you. We are entitled to operate on the basis that each order is correct and
            does not contain any errors (including in the case of manifest errors). Before you place an order, you must
            carefully confirm all of the information specified, including the type, price and quantity of digital
            assets, buying or selling instructions, applicable fees and other important matters in connection with the
            order.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.8 You acknowledge that the execution time of orders is based on the actual operation time of
            LetKnow. You have the right to revoke or amend your orders at any point before they are completed.
        </p>
        <p class="par">2.9 Trading on the LetKnow World Platforms may be subject to trading limits, which may be
            specified by LetKnow from time to time. LetKnow reserves the right to raise, lower or remove transaction
            limits at any time at its own discretion.

        <p class="par">2.10 If LetKnow uncovers an erroneous transaction caused by a system failure or any other reason,
            LetKnow has the right to correct the error regardless of whether it is beneficial to LetKnow or any user.
            Where, due to such an error, any user actually receives more digital assets than the amount that such an
            user should have received, LetKnow reserves the right to correct such improperly executed transactions and
            the user shall return the digital assets in question or perform other operations in accordance with
            LetKnowâs instructions to the user. The user acknowledges that LetKnow will not assume any losses or
            responsibilities caused by any such erroneous transaction.</p>
